🌍 GHG Emission Prediction Week 2 – Internship Project on Green Skills  
By: Sayera Mehreen Khan

📌 Project Overview  
Continuing from Week 1, this phase expands the GHG emissions prediction project with deeper data preprocessing and improvements in feature engineering. The focus is on refining the dataset and preparing it for robust model training.

The data includes industry and commodity-level emission factors from 2010 to 2016, sourced from data.gov.

📁 Files Included  
`GHG_Emissions_Prediction_Week2.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing:

- Enhanced data cleaning  
- Detailed handling of missing and invalid entries  
- Advanced encoding techniques  
- Feature analysis and visualization  
- Improved pipeline setup for regression modeling

🧠 Skills & Concepts Learned  
- Column-wise data cleaning and filtering  
- Deep dive into categorical vs numerical feature handling  
- Custom feature transformation logic  
- Data visualization for feature correlation and trend spotting  
- Laying groundwork for feature scaling (continued in Week 3)

⚙️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

✅ Status  
📌 Completed: All tasks taught and demonstrated up to Week 2  
💻 All code tested and runs successfully in a virtual environment  
📄 Week 3 tasks (starting from “Normalize FEATURES”) are not included
